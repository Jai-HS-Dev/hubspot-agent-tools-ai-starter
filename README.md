# HubSpot Agent Tools AI Starter

Build a small service that gives a HubSpot agent or workflow useful information.

**A guided blueprint with small examples, not a finished production integration.**
You do not need coding experience or a connected HubSpot account to begin.

## What This Helps You Build

Possible projects include a contact summary, a lookup in another system, or a follow-up suggestion. These are ideas to adapt, not installed features.

**Your first result:** Run a sample contact-summary service with made-up data, then plan one small tool of your own. Nothing is installed in HubSpot.

## Choose Your Starting Point

### I'm New To Coding

Follow [the step-by-step walkthrough](docs/start-here.md). It explains how to
open the project, where to type commands, what success looks like and how to stop.
Your assistant should ask one plain-language question at a time.

### I'm Building With AI

Open this repository in your coding assistant and use the prompt below. Start
with the same mock example before adapting a [feature recipe](recipes/README.md).

### I'm A Developer

Jump to [architecture](docs/developer-architecture.md), the
[data contract](docs/contracts/agent-tool-contract.md) and the example README.
The same safety and verification limits apply.

## Start With Your AI Assistant

Paste this into an assistant that can read the repository files:

```text
Read README.md, AGENTS.md and START_WITH_AI.md.
Help me build a HubSpot tool that [describe your goal].
Start with the mock example. Ask one question at a time.
Explain each command and its expected result before I run it.
Never ask me to paste secrets or customer data.
Ask for explicit approval before packages, account access, live writes or deployment.
```

[START_WITH_AI.md](START_WITH_AI.md) has the fuller first-conversation prompt.
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the canonical coding instructions; tool-specific files
point there. You can use different AI editors; automatic instruction loading varies.
No MCP connection is needed for the local example.

## Try The Safe Example

A **mock** uses made-up data. You need Node.js and npm; the examples declare
Node.js 22+, and the [walkthrough](docs/start-here.md) records the tested version
and setup guidance. This describes local examples, not managed HubSpot runtimes.

Download and extract the repository, then open a terminal in the folder containing
`README.md` and `package.json`. Run:

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run smoke:example
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
npm.cmd run doctor
npm.cmd run smoke:example
```

No `npm install`, credentials, HubSpot account or hosting is needed for this first
check. The doctor should report `"ok": true`; the example should end with:

```text
agent smoke example passed.
```

A local endpoint returned a sample contact brief. No real CRM data was read and no agent or workflow tool was installed.
The check closes its local server automatically.

If a command fails, stop and use [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).
Do not weaken security settings or enter live credentials to make it pass.

## What Is Included And What Isn't

| Example | Status and limits |
| --- | --- |
| [Contact brief example](examples/simple-contact-brief-agent-tool/README.md) | Runnable locally: mock HTTP endpoint. Workflow/tool definitions are illustrative, not a complete installable project. |

A real tool still needs a reviewed HubSpot caller adapter, account/user authorization, minimum permissions, hosting and developer-account tests. A service shared secret is for trusted server callers, never browser or card code.

[Evidence](EVIDENCE.md) and the [example catalog](examples/catalog.json) distinguish
local tests, illustrative code and remaining work. No example currently claims
developer-account verification or production readiness.

After the demo, follow one path: **describe your goal, run the mock, choose
authentication/hosting only if needed, make one small change, verify**.
Use the [blueprint](docs/agent-tool-blueprint.md) to plan that change.

[Authentication choices](docs/auth-options.md) and
[hosting choices](docs/hosting-options.md) explain alternatives, not ready-made
adapters for every provider. [Check which starter you need](docs/choose-your-path.md);
companion repositories are optional.

## Safety Essentials

1. Keep secrets and customer data out of AI chats, GitHub, screenshots and logs.
   Keep credentials server-side, never in browser/card code.
2. Use mock data first. Approve the exact account, minimum access and operation
   before live access, writes, publishing or deployment.
3. Passing local tests is not proof of security or production readiness.
   Review the [live-use checklist](REAL_TOOL_CHECKLIST.md) before real use.

Read [plain-English security guidance](docs/security-for-non-developers.md) and
[the approval gates](docs/non-developer-safety-gates.md) for the full process.

## Developer Reference

- [Architecture](docs/developer-architecture.md) and [contract](docs/contracts/agent-tool-contract.md).
- [Compatibility and reviewed versions](COMPATIBILITY.md), [migration guidance](MIGRATION.md) and [upgrade notes](UPGRADE_NOTES.md).
- [Optional feature recipes](docs/fall-2026-feature-recipes.md) and [verification evidence](EVIDENCE.md).

After the selected example's documented setup, run `npm run check:ai`,
`npm run check`, `npm test` and `npm run smoke:example` (use `npm.cmd` on Windows).
Report skipped or failed checks; mock checks do not verify a live installation.
