# HubSpot Agent Tools AI Starter

Build HubSpot agent tools and workflow-action-style endpoints with help from any AI coding tool.

**Guided starter, not a finished production integration.**

**Your first result:** Run a contact-brief endpoint with synthetic data, recognize its structured response, and write a small plan for your own tool. A local endpoint returns a sample contact brief. No tool is installed in HubSpot.


This starter is for three kinds of users:

- Non-developers who want an AI assistant to guide them one step at a time.
- Vibe coders who want to prototype real HubSpot tools without getting trapped by unsafe token handling.
- Developers who want clean contracts, mock-first examples, and portable hosting patterns.

This repo is AI-tool-neutral and hosting-neutral. It can be used with Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, or another coding assistant. It can be adapted to Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Render, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, a VPS, or HubSpot project functions where appropriate.

## Quick Start

Follow [your first working result](docs/start-here.md): describe your goal, run the
credential-free mock, choose auth/hosting only if needed, make one small change,
and verify what is still unfinished. No account connection is needed to begin.

Using an assistant? Open [START_WITH_AI.md](START_WITH_AI.md). It should ask one
plain-language question at a time. The walkthrough includes Windows commands,
expected output, stop instructions and [safe recovery](docs/troubleshooting.md).

Experienced developers can jump to [architecture](docs/developer-architecture.md)
and [the contract](docs/contracts/agent-tool-contract.md); the same evidence and safety limits apply.

## Current HubSpot Baseline

Read [EVIDENCE.md](EVIDENCE.md) for exactly what is implemented, tested locally,
and still needs developer-account or production verification. Run `npm test`
after setup as well as the smoke check; the two checks cover different behavior.
For behavior changes in existing copies, read [UPGRADE_NOTES.md](UPGRADE_NOTES.md).

This starter targets Developer Platform `2026.09`, date-based CRM API `2026-09`, and Node.js 22+. Read `COMPATIBILITY.md` before choosing auth or optional Fall 2026 features, and use `MIGRATION.md` when updating older code. New single-account system integrations should evaluate Service Keys; reusable apps should use OAuth.

Optional App Actions, Task Series, Activity Auto Associations, Agent Hub, and MCP recipes are in `docs/fall-2026-feature-recipes.md`.

Node.js 22+ above describes local examples, not every managed HubSpot runtime.
Workflow custom code now needs Node.js 24 async-return handlers. See
`MIGRATION.md` for the November editing deadlines and `COMPATIBILITY.md` for
the distinction between project functions, workflow actions, and external hosts.

## Pick Your Path

| You want | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| A first result without coding experience | [One guided walkthrough](docs/start-here.md) |
| A small feature to adapt with AI | The same walkthrough, then [recipes](recipes/README.md) |
| Contracts and implementation details | [Architecture](docs/developer-architecture.md) and [contracts](docs/contracts/agent-tool-contract.md) |

[Choose your scope](docs/choose-your-path.md) before combining repositories. One
starter may be enough; companions are optional, not an installation bundle.

## If You Are An AI Coding Tool

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the canonical operating guidance.
[START_WITH_AI.md](START_WITH_AI.md) starts the conversation; README.md explains
scope; [docs/start-here.md](docs/start-here.md) is the beginner path.
Read the selected example, [catalog](examples/catalog.json) and [evidence](EVIDENCE.md)
before claiming anything is implemented. Tool-specific adapters delegate to AGENTS.md.

## What This Repo Is

- A beginner-friendly guide for building HubSpot agent tools.
- An AI-readable project structure with instructions for coding assistants.
- A mock-first example that can become a real endpoint.
- A security-first reference for tokens, OAuth, hosting, and environment variables.

## What This Repo Is Not

- It is not an official HubSpot product.
- It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by HubSpot.
- It is not a security audit, legal recommendation, or production guarantee.
- It does not include private deployment URLs, real HubSpot account IDs, access tokens, client secrets, or customer data.

## Example Included

```text
examples/simple-contact-brief-agent-tool/
```

It includes:

- HubSpot project metadata placeholders.
- A sample workflow-action-style definition.
- A small Node HTTP endpoint using mock data by default.
- A path to replace mock data with server-side HubSpot API access.

## Example Labels

[examples/catalog.json](examples/catalog.json) lists every example and its limits.
**Runnable locally** means the stated mock/offline check runs after its documented
setup. **Illustrative** means a pattern or scaffold, not a complete runnable or
deployable integration. **Developer-account verified** requires recorded installed
evidence; none of these examples currently claims it. **Production prerequisites**
are work to review, not a certification or an included production service.

| Example | Status | What the local evidence covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [examples/simple-contact-brief-agent-tool](examples/simple-contact-brief-agent-tool/README.md) | Runnable locally | Mock HTTP endpoint; workflow/tool metadata is illustrative, not an installed tool. |

Use [EVIDENCE.md](EVIDENCE.md) for the current verification record. Every example's
README also states its status and points to the remaining live-use checklist.

## Security First

Never paste these into an AI chat:

- HubSpot private app tokens
- OAuth client secrets
- OAuth refresh tokens or access tokens
- Hosting provider API tokens
- Database URLs
- Customer names, emails, phone numbers, notes, deals, tickets, or CRM exports

Use placeholders in chat, for example:

```text
HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=<stored in hosting secret manager>
```

## From Demo To Your Feature

Keep the [single guided path](docs/start-here.md): goal, mock, auth/hosting decision,
one small build, verification. You may stop at mock-only learning. Before real use,
finish [the checklist](REAL_TOOL_CHECKLIST.md) and obtain scoped approval; successful
mock tests are not a deployment or permission to touch live data.

## License And Implementation Responsibility

This starter is released under the MIT license in `LICENSE`. That makes it permissive for learning, copying, modifying, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, and building real projects, as long as the required copyright and license notices are preserved when substantial portions are reused.

The MIT license includes the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations in [LICENSE](LICENSE). This starter is not legal advice, a security audit, a compliance review, HubSpot approval, marketplace approval, or a production guarantee. Builders are responsible for reviewing, configuring, testing, and operating their implementations.

Before using generated code with real HubSpot data or real users, review `docs/implementation-responsibility.md`, `REAL_TOOL_CHECKLIST.md`, and `docs/non-developer-safety-gates.md`. Builders are responsible for checking their own HubSpot developer requirements, auth model, scopes, hosting setup, token storage, privacy obligations, platform terms, and production readiness.
